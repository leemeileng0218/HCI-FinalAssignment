        <!-- ===== Izu Kawazu Section (ADDED) ===== -->
        <section class="destination-details">
            <h2>Izu Kawazu (Japan)</h2>

            <div class="images">
                <img src="kawazu1.jpg"  width = "450"alt=" Kawazu Japan 1">
                <img src="kawazu3.jpg" width = "450"  height =  alt=" Kawazu Japan 2">
          </div>      
              
          <p>
                Kawazu is a charming town on the east coast of Japan's Izu Peninsula, part of Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park and a UNESCO Global Geopark. It is most renowned for the early-blooming Kawazu Sakura, which flowers from mid-February to early March—when much of Japan is still cold, Kawazu is painted pink. The area also boasts stunning natural landscapes, hot springs, fresh seafood, and locally grown wasabi, making it a year-round destination for travelers.
            </p>

            <p>
                Key attractions include the nearly 4km-long Kawazu Cherry Blossom Road lining the Kawazu River, the Kawazu Seven Waterfalls (Nanadaru) with easy hiking trails and an outdoor hot spring near the 20-meter Odaru Falls, and the dramatic Kawazu Nanadaru Loop Bridge. Imaihama Beach is popular for swimming and sunbathing in summer, and hosts a vibrant fireworks display in mid-August. Other highlights are IZOO sensory zoo, Kawazu Bagatelle Park with its French-style rose garden and cafe, and the scenic Funado no Banya seaview hot spring.
            </p>

            <p>
                The town offers a range of experiences: canyoning and paragliding in summer, hiking in the Amagi Mountain Range in autumn, and soaking in hot springs year-round. Local cuisine features fresh seafood paired with wasabi, and visitors can stay in traditional ryokans for an authentic onsen experience. Nearby, you can explore the family-friendly Higashi Izu seaside town or the historic port town of Shimoda.
            </p>

        <!-- ===== Takayama Morning Market Section (ADDED) ===== -->
        <section class="destination-details">
            <h2>Takayama (Japan)</h2>

            <div class="market-images">
                <img src="photo/takayama1.jpg" alt="Takayama Morning Market 1">
                <img src="photo/takayama2.jpg" alt="Takayama Morning Market 2">
                
              
            </div>
<p>
                Situated in the heart of Japan's Hida Mountains, Takayama is a timeless mountain city that feels frozen in time. Often called the "Little Kyoto of the North," it seamlessly blends centuries-old traditions with gentle modern touches, offering travelers a rare glimpse into the authentic rural life and craftsmanship of old Japan.
            </p>

            <p>
                The enchanting Sannomachi District forms the city's historic core, where narrow cobblestone lanes wind past well-preserved wooden machiya houses—many now housing traditional sake breweries, handcrafted lacquerware shops, and cozy teahouses serving sweet red bean treats. The bustling morning markets at Jinya-mae and along Miyagawa River are local treasures, brimming with pickled vegetables, handmade textiles, fresh mountain herbs, and grilled Hida beef skewers that melt in your mouth.
            </p>

            <p>
                Must-see sights include Takayama Jinya, a magnificent Edo-period administrative complex with meticulously maintained gardens and historic courtrooms; Hida Folk Village, an open-air museum with over 30 traditional farmhouses showcasing rural architecture from across the Hida region; and the world-famous Takayama Festivals. Held in April and October, these spectacular events feature towering, intricately carved wooden floats adorned with gold leaf and delicate lanterns, paraded through the streets as part of centuries-old Shinto rituals.
            </p>

            <h3>Getting There and Around</h3>

            <div class="map-image">
                <img src="photo/takayama-map.jpg" alt="Takayama Location Map">
            </div>

            <p>
                From Tokyo, take the JR Hokuriku Shinkansen to Toyama or Kanazawa, then transfer to the JR Takayama Line (total journey time around 3.5–4 hours). Alternatively, take a direct highway bus from Tokyo, Osaka, or Kyoto (journey time 4–5 hours). Once in Takayama, the old town is easily explored on foot, and local buses connect to outlying attractions like Hida Folk Village.
            </p>

            <p>
                Visit in spring (April–May) for cherry blossoms or autumn (October–November) for fall foliage and the Takayama Autumn Festival. Stay in a traditional ryokan (inn) to experience tatami rooms, kaiseki dining, and hot spring baths. Don’t leave without trying Hida beef—one of Japan’s top three premium beef varieties—served as steak, shabu-shabu, or sukiyaki.
            </p>

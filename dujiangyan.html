                The Dujiangyan Irrigation System, built in the Warring States Period (475-221 B.C.) under the direction of Li Bing, governor of Shu in the State of Qin, is the world's oldest and only functioning water conservation project that uses a unique method of diverting water without constructing a dam. Situated on the Minjiang River west of the Chengdu Plain, it has been listed as a UNESCO World Cultural and Natural Heritage Site and on the International Commission on Irrigation and Drainage's list of World Heritage Irrigation Structures, and is hailed as a model of harmonious human-nature interaction.
            </p>

            <p>
                The system takes full advantage of the local terrain, which is higher in the northwest and lower in the southeast. It consists of three core components: the Fish Mouth Embankment that divides the river into inner and outer streams, the Flying Sand Weir for flood discharge and sediment control, and the Bottle-Neck Channel for water diversion and flow regulation. These parts work together to provide flood protection, irrigation, water transportation, and daily water use, transforming the Chengdu Plain into the "Land of Abundance" that it remains today.
            </p>

            <p>
                Key highlights include the Anlan Cable Bridge spanning the Minjiang River, the Erwang Temple dedicated to Li Bing and his son, the Fulong Temple with its ancient statues and inscriptions, and the nearby Mount Qingcheng, a famous Taoist mountain also listed as a World Heritage Site. Visitors can also explore the Dujiangyan Museum to learn about the project's history and engineering principles.

            <p>
                Dujiangyan is easily accessible from Chengdu. High-speed trains run frequently from Chengdu's Xipu Railway Station to Dujiangyan Station, with travel times of 18-47 minutes and ticket prices ranging from CNY 10 to 27. Some trains also go directly to Qingchengshan Station, which is close to both Dujiangyan and Mount Qingcheng. Coaches are also available from Chengdu to Dujiangyan, taking 1-2 hours with fares of CNY 15-35.
            </p>

            <p>
                Within Dujiangyan, the irrigation system site is walkable, with paved paths connecting all major attractions. Shuttle buses and taxis are available for travel between the site and nearby areas like Mount Qingcheng. The site is wheelchair and stroller accessible, with ramps and accessible restrooms provided.
            </p>

            <p>
                Visit early in the morning to avoid crowds and enjoy cooler temperatures, or in the late afternoon for beautiful sunset views over the Minjiang River. Try local Sichuan snacks like mapo tofu, kung pao chicken, and sweet water noodles at restaurants near the site. After your visit, consider exploring Mount Qingcheng or taking a trip to Chengdu to experience more of Sichuan's culture and cuisine.
